   First Steps
******************

Connect to the Pokerserver
==========================

Typical Start
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. handshake
2. authenticate
3. get tables
4. user actions

Handshake
~~~~~~~~~

Open a TCP connection to the poker service. You will receive a line like `CGI 002.200\\n`. You have to respond with your protocol version number with the same format `CGI <major>.<minor>\\n`. If the versions differ the connection is closed immediately. After the connection is opend you must not use any delimiter for the packets.

It is a standard TCP connection.

The Packets that will be sent are C-Structs.

Authenticate
~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will not explain the method of authetication at the moment. As soon we decided how to do it, we will update this documentation.

After you are autheticated you can ask for a table list. This list will include all basic information about the tables (including names, free seats, and the poker server)

Get tables
~~~~~~~~~~

We will update this section as soon we have a final solution for this.

User Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you chose a table :ref:`sit down <sit>`.

During a hand are :ref:`this packets <hand>` possible.

Explain or no explain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Theoretically it is possible to ask the pokerserver for more packages. Therfore you could send an :class:`PACKET_POKER_EXPLAIN <pokerpackets.networkpackets.PacketPokerExplain>`. 

It would be much better if the client could work without explains since it reduces the performance impact to the server.

Look at the `implementation <https://github.com/pokermania/poker-network/blob/master/poker-network/pokernetwork/pokerexplain.py#L270>`_ on github for an idea how it could be done.
